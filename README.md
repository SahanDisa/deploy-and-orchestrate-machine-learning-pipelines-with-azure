# Azure Machine Learning Lab Exercises

This repository contains the hands-on lab exercises for Microsoft course [DP-100 *Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure*](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/courses/dp-100t01) and the equivalent [self-paced modules on Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/paths/build-ai-solutions-with-azure-ml-service/). The labs are designed to accompany the learning materials and enable you to practice using the technologies described them.

When using these labs in an instructoe-led course, students should use the Azure subscription provided for the course.

## What are we doing?

- To support this course, we will need to make frequent updates to the course content to keep it current with the Azure services used in the course.  We are publishing the lab instructions and lab files on GitHub to keep the content current with changes in the Azure platform.

- We hope that this brings a sense of collaboration to the labs like we've never had before - when Azure changes and you find it first during a live delivery, go ahead and submit a pull-request to update the lab content.  Help your fellow MCTs.

## How should I use these files relative to the released MOC files?

- The instructor guide and PowerPoints are still going to be your primary source for teaching the course content.

- These files on GitHub are designed to be used in the course labs.

- It will be recommended that for every delivery, trainers check GitHub for any changes that may have been made to support the latest Azure services.

## What about changes to the student handbook?

- We will review the student handbook on a quarterly basis and update through the normal MOC release channels as needed.

## How do I contribute?

- Any MCT can submit a pull request to the code or content in the GitHub repo, Microsoft and the course author will triage and include content and lab code changes as needed.

- If you have suggestions or spot any errors, please report them as [issues](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/mslearn-dp100/issues).

## Notes

### Classroom Materials

The labs are provided in this GitHub repo rather than in the student materials in order to (a.) share them with other learning modalities, and (b.) ensure that the latest version of the lab files is always used in classroom deliveries. This approach reflects the nature of an always-changing cloud-based interface and platform.

Anyone can access the files in this repo, but Microsoft Learning support is limited to MCTs teaching this course only.
